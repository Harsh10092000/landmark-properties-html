        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",

          "@type": "Answer",

Budget an additional 10-15% of the property value for these expenses. Our property cost calculator helps estimate total investment requirements accurately."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Consider these factors: Buying offers long-term investment benefits, equity building, and stability, while renting provides flexibility and lower upfront costs. Calculate the price-to-rent ratio in your area - if it's below 15, buying might be favorable. Consider your financial stability, job security, and long-term plans. Factor in maintenance costs, property appreciation potential, and tax benefits. Our financial advisors can help analyze your specific situation and provide personalized recommendations for optimal decision-making."
